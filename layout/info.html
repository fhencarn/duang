Written Works & Contributors

White Holes; Fernando Hernandez
Objects theorized to exist only as the opposite of black holes—places where matter and time are expelled but never entered, observed only through mathematics and imagination.

Virtual Currency; Benjamin Bello
Value without substance, ownership without touch, belief encoded into numbers that exist only because we collectively agree they do.

Placebo Effect; Fernando Hernandez
An outcome caused not by medicine or action, but by belief itself—proof that the mind can manufacture reality where none should exist.

Free Will; Fernando Hernandez
The idea that choice is truly ours, questioned by systems, incentives, algorithms, and unseen forces shaping every decision we believe we make.

Ghosts; Benjamin Bello
Presences defined by absence—entities said to remain after life, existing between memory, fear, and unfinished stories.

Luck; Benjamin Bello
An invisible force blamed or praised for randomness, success, and failure—order imposed on chaos by human interpretation.

Dreams; Fernando Hernandez
Worlds constructed nightly by the subconscious, vivid and emotional yet impossible to hold, disappearing the moment we wake.

A Square Circle; Fernando Hernandez
A logical impossibility—an object that cannot exist by definition, yet can still be imagined, discussed, and visualized.

Dragons; Benjamin Bello
Creatures that never existed physically, yet appear across cultures, myths, and histories as if humanity collectively remembers them.

Elior / Liliweiss (V.T.C. Archive); Benjamin Bello
A fragmented personal account of creation, loss, and belief—where a machine became a symbol, and a symbol became something almost alive.
