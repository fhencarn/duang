      <h2>What does it mean for something to not exist?   </h2>
      <p>For something to not exist is has to be zero. For something to be zero there has to be nothing there. The best answer would be not to answer the existing question. To speak about the non existentance of something brings it to existentse for the sake of the example. With just words and thoughts something that was non-existent becomes existent. In some shape or form what we believe or think becomes true. But once we stop thinking about does it go away? And I mean completely, does it go back to not existing? Lets say I had a organe, once I eat it, does it still exist? If not, how come? The orange might not physically exist but its still something that was real, I mean I was holding it and now its in my body. Not the same orange you knew but still there, just in pieces. Everything exists but just in pieces

      <h2>Dragons </h2>
      <img src="../images/pest_control.png" alt="Imaginary Things placeholder image" />
      <p>Dragons be Wear.. There was a phase that everyone went through of wanting to own one of these. Giant, fire-breathing lizards that can take to the skies and incinerate the town in a few seconds. The fantasy ended the moment someone actually saw one—its shadow swept across the fields first, blotting out the sun, followed by a low rumble that shook the windows. It wasn’t the elegant creature from the storybooks but something ancient and heavy with smoke, eyes burning with the memory of forgotten empires. For a breathless moment, the world felt ha small again, and everyone remembered why dragons were meant to be admired from a very safe distance. .. I should give this game a break..

      <h2>Virtual Currency </h2>
      <img src="../images/imagehere.jpeg" alt="Imaginary Things placeholder image" />
      <p>The value of virtual currency. It’s hilariously easy how right clicking and pressing “save image” can destroy a person’s life. Virtual Currency, NFTs, even ATMs are not safe. The digital age promised ownership without borders, but instead, it gave us confusion without limits. What’s real when everything can be copied? A million dollar picture means nothing if anyone can screenshot it. Yet, somehow, it still means everything. to some its status, proof, ego. Money used to be about what you could hold. Now, it’s about what you can claim. And claims, in the online world, are as fragile as a forgotten password or a crashed server. Maybe the real currency isn’t the token, or the chain, or the code. Maybe it’s belief, the collective illusion that something intangible still has worth. Because when the Wi-Fi dies, so does your fortune. </p>

      <h2>Free will</h2>
      <img src="../images/imagehere.jpeg" alt="Imaginary Things placeholder image" />
      <p>How free will isn’t free You like free things. Your actions aren’t free though. Thinking isnt free. You didn’t choose coffee this morning. Caffeine chose you. Your genes negotiated it while you were asleep. You think you like that one song? Congratulations, your dopamine receptors just signed a contract with the Spotify algorithm. There’s always someone enforcing. Someone judging. Someone listening Maybe it’s the government, maybe it’s God, or maybe it’s just your phone, the trinity of modern surveillance. You think you’re free when you close the curtains, but your smart fridge is still snitching on you for buying off-brand soda. Free will? Please. You didn’t even choose that. A marketing algorithm whispered it into your skull at 3 a.m. while you were doomscrolling. Every click is a confession. Every purchase is a prayer to the gods of targeted advertising. </p>

      <h2>Ghost</h2>
      <img src="../images/imagehere.jpeg" alt="Imaginary Things placeholder image" />
      <p>Everyone wants proof of ghosts. Cold spots, flickering lights, footsteps in an empty hallway. As if the dead would bother performing parlor tricks just to be believed. The truth is, ghosts are everywhere and no one notices because they don’t rattle chains anymore. In inactive accounts that still recommend you as a friend. In houses that remember where the furniture used to be and make the air feel wrong when you move it. A ghost isn’t a sheet with eye holes, it's unfinished business with nobody left to deal with. </p>

      <h2>Luck</h2>
      <img src="../images/imagehere.jpeg" alt="Imaginary Things placeholder image" />
      <p>Luck is the only thing everyone believes in but no one wants to credit. We call it timing, opportunity, being “in the right place,” as if that makes it fairer. Two people work just as hard one gets a miracle, the other gets a lesson. History remembers one as talented and the other as unlucky, which is just a polite way of saying the universe didn’t bother to look their way. Luck has no personality, no moral code. It doesn’t reward effort or punish laziness; it just happens. A delayed train, a wrong turn, a message sent five minutes later than intended tiny accidents that quietly decide entire lives. We pretend success is a formula because randomness is terrifying. But deep down, everyone knows the truth: skill gets you to the door, luck decides whether it’s unlocked. And once you’re inside, you’ll swear you earned the view. </p>

      <h2>Dreams</h2>
      <img src="../images/imagehere.jpeg" alt="Imaginary Things placeholder image" />
      <p>Can you even remeber the last vivid dream you had? What happens in that world stays in that world. No one knows what you do in your dreams. People don’t ask either. Dreams are controlled by your brain and your brain can be the biggest perciver of them all. It all feels so real but none of it exists. Isn’t it scary how you forget your dreams. Like you lived those moments for a while but once you open your eyes you only have faint memories. Easy to forget and hard to remember.   </p>

      <h2>A square circle</h2>
      <img src="../images/imagehere.jpeg" alt="Imaginary Things placeholder image" />
      <p>
        Which means constructing a square with the same area as a circle. That does not sound hard at all. Why don’t we make a circle out of something easy to mush. Then use tools to squah it into a square. Bam, square cirlce. But... I was thinking of a Circle that appears as sqaure to the human eye. Sure this can be solved with optical illusions. But in a literal sense, if the 4th dimensions is the way we think it is then could this achieabel. In a 2d world if a 3d object were to pass through then it would look 1d. Which would be a line I’m guessing. Since we are 3d and see things in 2d. If a 4d object passed through our 3d world then what would the 2d shape be. The real questions should be what type of 4d circle would create, what we call, a square in the 3d world.
