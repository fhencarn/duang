      <p class="mystery">
        Whispered online as a “character that isn’t a character,” <em>duang</em> began as a sound,
        then became a sign—an internet echo often described as a non-existent Chinese character.
        It has no fixed strokes, yet it travels; no official body, yet it gathers meaning. This
        museum follows that ripple: a gallery of myths, concepts, blueprints, and digital phantoms
        that move people without ever taking a solid form. Step carefully—some absences feel almost real.
