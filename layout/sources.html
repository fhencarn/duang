          <h3>White Holes — Fernando Hernandez</h3>
          <p>Objects theorized to exist only as the opposite of black holes—places where matter and time are expelled but never entered, observed only through mathematics and imagination.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Virtual Currency — Benjamin Bello</h3>
          <p>Value without substance, ownership without touch, belief encoded into numbers that exist only because we collectively agree they do.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Placebo Effect — Fernando Hernandez</h3>
          <p>An outcome caused not by medicine or action, but by belief itself—proof that the mind can manufacture reality where none should exist.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Free Will — Fernando Hernandez</h3>
          <p>The idea that choice is truly ours, questioned by systems, incentives, algorithms, and unseen forces shaping every decision we believe we make.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Ghosts — Benjamin Bello</h3>
          <p>Presences defined by absence—entities said to remain after life, existing between memory, fear, and unfinished stories.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Luck — Benjamin Bello</h3>
          <p>An invisible force blamed or praised for randomness, success, and failure—order imposed on chaos by human interpretation.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Dreams — Fernando Hernandez</h3>
          <p>Worlds constructed nightly by the subconscious, vivid and emotional yet impossible to hold, disappearing the moment we wake.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>A Square Circle — Fernando Hernandez</h3>
          <p>A logical impossibility—an object that cannot exist by definition, yet can still be imagined, discussed, and visualized.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Dragons — Benjamin Bello</h3>
          <p>Creatures that never existed physically, yet appear across cultures, myths, and histories as if humanity collectively remembers them.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Elior / Liliweiss (V.T.C. Archive) — Benjamin Bello</h3>
          <p>A fragmented personal account of creation, loss, and belief—where a machine became a symbol, and a symbol became something almost alive.</p>
